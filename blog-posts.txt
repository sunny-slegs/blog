Steps taken to start SPA blog with vanilla js:
1. set up hierarchy of files from https://dev.to/vinay20045/building-a-single-page-application-with-vanilla-js
2. outline utils skeleton functions but with console logs and no actual logic
3. make sure init calls utils.router correctly

The templates are like madlibs with a reusable structure that take variable inputs
The controllers are functions that decide what varialbes the templates will use
The view is invoked by the router and then calls the controller to populate the template

router --> view --> controller(render) --> template

Post about setting up a very simple SPA
This is how I set up a verrrry simple SPA without using a framework.  I did this project because I wanted
to understand what goes on under the hood of frameworks like React and Vue.  Obviously they are super complex
software projects but I wanted to get a better understanding of what a SPA is at its core.  Basically 


 <script>
    const menuIcon = document.getElementById("mobile-nav-icon");
    const overlay = document.getElementById("overlay");
    const body = document.getElementById("body");
    function showOverlay() {
      overlay.className = "show-nav-overlay";
      menuIcon.className = "hide-mobile-nav-icon";
    }
    function hideOverlay() {
      console.log("hide overlay");
      overlay.className = "hide-nav-overlay";
      menuIcon.className = "mobile-nav-icon";
    }
  </script>
