Steps taken to start SPA blog with vanilla js:
1. set up hierarchy of files from https://dev.to/vinay20045/building-a-single-page-application-with-vanilla-js
2. outline utils skeleton functions but with console logs and no actual logic
3. make sure init calls utils.router correctly

The templates are like madlibs with a reusable structure that take variable inputs
The controllers are functions that decide what varialbes the templates will use
The view is invoked by the router and then calls the controller to populate the template
